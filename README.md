# GCDOperations
Operations based purely on GCD.

## Purpose
This project aims to provide Operations very similar to Foundation.Operation. However, instead of heavily relying on KVO and the like, this library implements it using purerly GCD features.
On top of that, this library embraces what Apple initially showed in in the ["Advanced Operations" WWDC Talk](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/226/).
However, these features were enhanced by the changes described in [this repository](https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/PSOperations/).

#  Credits
All features known from the WWDC Talk  [Advanced Operations](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/226/) have only encountered slight adjustments.
So big thanks to Apple for the ideas and initial implementation of these features.
Also, thanks to pluralsight for adding tests and fixing some bugs [here](https://github.com/pluralsight/PSOperations/)
